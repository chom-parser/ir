# Chom Intermediate Representation

This library defines `chom-ir`, the intermediate representation used by
the parser generator Chom.
It is a purely functional programming language dedicated to parsing.
It can itself be parsed by an easy-to-write LL1 parser,
to be then translated into various target languages.
It is also human readable so it can be easily debugged.
